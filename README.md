This Python script helps match job descriptions (JDs) with candidate profiles by leveraging AI embeddings and a vector similarity search. It uses HuggingFace embeddings, ChromaDB, and an LLMChain for extracting and comparing data. Here's an overview of its steps:

Preprocessing Job Descriptions:

The preprocess_jd function combines key fields (like title, skills, and location) into a single text block for embedding and storage.
Storing JDs in ChromaDB:

The script takes a CSV file containing JDs, preprocesses the data, and stores the embeddings along with metadata in ChromaDB for later retrieval.
Extracting Profile Details via LLMChain:

A Language Learning Model (LLM) extracts structured details (title, skills, etc.) from profile text using a predefined prompt template.
The extracted profile details are stored in ChromaDB.
Matching Profiles with JDs:

The script calculates similarity between the stored JDs and profile details using ChromaDB's similarity search.
The results include the best-matching JD for each profile, along with a similarity percentage.
User Interaction:

Users input the JD CSV file path and up to 4 profile links.
The script processes the data step-by-step and outputs matching results.
Key Features
HuggingFace Embeddings: Used for converting textual data into vector representations.
LLMChain for Profile Parsing: Extracts structured profile information based on the same keys as the JD CSV file.
ChromaDB: A vector database for efficient storage and similarity-based retrieval.
Similarity Matching: Finds the closest JDs for each profile based on vector similarity.
This script is designed to streamline the hiring process by automating profile matching to job descriptions.
