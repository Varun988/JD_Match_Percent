This Python script helps match job descriptions (JDs) with candidate profiles by leveraging AI embeddings and a vector similarity search. It uses HuggingFace embeddings, ChromaDB, and an LLMChain for extracting and comparing data. Here's an overview of its steps:

The code you provided performs Job Description (JD) Matching with Profile Extraction using LLMs and Vector Databases. The workflow can be summarized as follows:

1. JD Extraction from Document
a document (e.g., PDF, DOCX, or text file) is uploaded.
The LLM analyzes the document and extracts structured information such as:
Title, Description, Skills, Location, Experience, Salary
The extracted data is stored in JSON format for further processing.
The preprocessing function formats the extracted text for vector embedding.
2. Storing JDs in Vector Database
The extracted JD data is embedded using HuggingFaceâ€™s Sentence Transformers.
Stored in ChromaDB, a vector database used for efficient similarity searches.
Persistence is enabled, so the embeddings remain available across multiple runs.
3. Profile Data Extraction from URLs
The application takes up to 4 profile links.
Uses UnstructuredURLLoader to scrape the text from career pages.
Extracts structured details (Title, Skills, Experience, etc.) using LLM-based parsing.
Stores extracted profiles in ChromaDB as embeddings.
4. Matching JDs with Profiles
Using vector similarity search, JDs and extracted profiles are compared.
Top matching profiles are retrieved for each JD.
A matching percentage is calculated based on vector similarity scores.
Results are displayed, showing how well a profile matches a JD.


## Benefits of This Approach
1. Automation & Accuracy
The LLM extracts key details from unstructured JD documents and profile texts.
Automates manual screening, reducing effort and errors.
2. Efficient Matching with Vector Embeddings
Uses sentence embeddings for semantic understanding, beyond keyword matching.
Finds contextually relevant matches even if wording differs.
3. Scalability & Performance
ChromaDB ensures fast retrieval even for large datasets.
Can handle thousands of JDs and profiles efficiently.
4. Flexibility
Works with multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
Supports different programming languages and job roles.
5. Real-time Profile Matching
Fetches live job postings from URLs instead of using static data.
Ensures up-to-date recruitment insights.
